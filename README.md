# Phytochemical-protein interaction (PCPI) network: Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia L.) against colorectal cancer
_Created by Yumi L. Briones, Alexander T. Young, Fabian M. Dayrit, Armando Jerome H. De Jesus Jr., and Nina Rosario L. Rojas_

Stuff I used to build a network showing how phytochemicals in bitter gourd interact with proteins in colorectal cancer pathways (https://yumibriones.github.io/network/index.html). The workflow is transferable to other medicinal plants and diseases. I also published a [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/bioinformatics/articles/10.3389/fbinf.2021.768886/full) on this.

I should probably revisit this and add more details but for now, feel free to browse!
